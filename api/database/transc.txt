"What the hell...?"
"{i}What the hell??{/i}"
"Is this a nightmare?"
"It...has to be."
"This isn't real."
"There's no way this can be real."
"Sayori wouldn't do this."
"Everything was normal up until a few days ago."
"That's why I can't believe what my eyes are showing me...!"
"I suppress the urge to vomit."
"Just yesterday..."
"I told Sayori I would be there for her."
"I told her I know what's best, and that everything will be okay."
"Then why...?"
"Why would she do this...?"
"How could I be so helpless?"
"Confessing to her..."
"I shouldn't have confessed to her."
"That's not what Sayori needed at all."
"She even told me how painful it is for others to care about her."
"Then why did I confess to her, and make her feel even worse?"
"Why was I so selfish?"
"This is my fault--!"
"My swarming thoughts keep telling me everything I could have done to prevent this."
"If I just spent more time with her."
"Walked her to school."
"And remained friends with her, like it always has been..."
"...Then I could have prevented this."
"I know I could have prevented this!"
"Screw the Literature Club."
"Screw the festival."
"I just...lost my best friend."
"Someone I grew up with."
"She's gone forever now."
"Nothing I do can bring her back."
"This isn't some game where I can reset and try something different."
"I had only one chance, and I wasn't careful enough."
"And now I'll carry this guilt with me until I die."
"Nothing in my life is worth more than hers..."
"But I still couldn't do what she needed from me."
"And now..."
"I can never take it back."
"Never."
"Never."
"Never."
"Never."
"Never..."
