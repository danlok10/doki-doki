m "By the way, did you remember to write a poem last night?"
mc "Y-Yeah..."
"My relaxation ends."
"I can't believe I agreed to do something so embarrassing."
"I couldn't really find much inspiration, since I've never really done this before."
m "Well, now that everyone's ready, why don't you find someone to share with?"
"Sayori and Monika enthusiastically pull out their poems."
"Sayori's is on a wrinkled sheet of loose leaf torn from a spiral notebook."
"On the other hand, Monika wrote hers in a composition notebook."
"I can already see Monika's pristine handwriting from where I sit."
"Natsuki and Yuri reluctantly comply as well, reaching into their bags."
"I do the same, myself."
mc "Phew..."
"I guess that's everyone."
"I glance around the room."
"That was a little more stressful than I anticipated."
"It's as if everyone is judging me for my mediocre writing abilities..."
"Even if they're just being nice, there's no way my poems can stand up to theirs."
"This is a literature club, after all."
"I sigh."
"I guess that's what I ended up getting myself into."
"Across the room, Sayori and Monika are happily chatting."
"My eyes land on Yuri and Natsuki."
"They gingerly exchange sheets of paper, sharing their respective poems."
"As they read in tandem, I watch each of their expressions change."
"Natsuki's eyebrows furrow in frustration."
"Meanwhile, Yuri smiles sadly."

y 2f "Eh?"
y "Um...did you say something?"
n 2c "Oh, it's nothing."
"Natsuki dismissively returns the poem to the desk with one hand."
n "I guess you could say it's fancy."
y 2i "Ah-- Thanks..."
y "Yours is...cute..."
n 2h "Cute?"
n 1h "Did you completely miss the symbolism or something?"
n "It's clearly about the feeling of giving up."

y 3f "I-I know that!"
y "I just meant..."
y 3h "The language, I guess..."
y "I was trying to say something nice..."
n "Eh?"
n 4w "You mean you have to try that hard to come up with something nice to say?"

y 1i "Um..."
y "Well, I do have a couple suggestions..." 
n 5x "Hmph."
n "If I was looking for suggestions, I would have asked someone who actually liked it."

n 5e "Sayori liked it."
n "And [player] did, too!"
n "So based on that, I'll gladly give you some suggestions of my own."
n "First of all--"
y 2l "Excuse me..."
y "I appreciate the offer, but I've spent a long time establishing my writing style."
y 2h "I don't expect it to change anytime soon, unless of course I come across something particularly inspiring."

y 1n "E-Eh?!"
y "That's not what I...!"
y 1o "Uu..."
y "You...You're just..."
"Yuri stands up as well."
y 2r "Maybe you're just jealous that [player] appreciates my advice more than he appreciated yours!"

s "I-I don't like fighting, guys...!"

y 2n "[player]...!"
y "She-- She's just trying to make me look bad...!"
n 4w "That's not true!"
n "She started it!"
n 4e "If she could get over herself and learn to appreciate that {i}simple{/i} writing is more effective..."
n "Then this wouldn't have happened in the first place!"
n "What's the point in making your poems all convoluted for no reason?"
n "The meaning should jump out at the reader, not force them to have to figure it out."
n 1f "Help me explain that to her, [player]!"
y 3o "W-Wait!"
y "There's a reason we have so many deep and expressive words in our language!"
y 3w "It's the only way to convey complex feelings and meaning the most effectively."
y "Avoiding them is not only unnecessarily limiting yourself...it's also a waste!"
y 1t "You understand that, right, [player]?"
mc "Um...!"
ny "Well??"
mc "..."
"How did I get dragged into this in the first place?!"
"It's not like I know anything about writing..."
"But whomever I agree with, they'll probably think more highly of me!"
"So, of course that's going to be...!"
m "Okay, everyone!"
m "It's just about time for us to leave."
m "How did you all feel about sharing poems?"
s "It was a lot of fun!"
y "Well, I'd say it was worth it."
n "It was alright. Well, mostly."
m 1a "[player], how about you?"
mc "...Yeah, I'd say the same."
mc "It was a neat thing to talk about with everyone."
m 1j "Awesome!"
m 1a "In that case, we'll do the same thing tomorrow."
m "And maybe you learned something from your friends, too."
m 3b "So your poems will turn out even better!"
mc "..."
"I think to myself."
"I did learn a little more about the kinds of poems everyone likes."
"With any luck, that means I can at least do a better job impressing those I want to impress."
"I nod to myself with newfound determination."
s "[player]!"
s "Ready to walk home?"
mc "Sure, let's go."
s 4q "Ehehe~"
"Sayori beams at me."
"It truly has been a while since Sayori and I have spent this much time together."
"I can't really say I'm not enjoying it, either."
mc "Sayori..."
mc "About what happened earlier..."
s 1b "Eh? What do you mean?"
mc "You know, between Yuri and Natsuki."
mc "Does that kind of thing happen often?"
s 4j "No, no, no!"
s "That's really the first time I've seen them fight like that..."
s "I promise they're both wonderful people."
s 1g "You don't... You don't hate them, do you??"
mc "No, I don't hate them!"
mc "I just wanted your opinion, that's all."
mc "I can see why they'd make good friends with you."
s 1d "Phew..."
s "You know, [player]..."
s "It's nice that I get to spend time with you in the club."
s "But I think seeing you get along with everyone is what makes me the happiest."
s 1x "And I think everyone really likes you, too!"
mc "That's--!"
s 4q "Ehehe~"
s "Every day is going to be so much fun~"
mc "Sigh..."
"It looks like Sayori still hasn't caught onto the kind of situation I'm in."
"Sure, being friends with everyone is nice, but..."
"...Does it really need to stop there?"
mc "We'll just have to see what the future holds, Sayori."
"I pat Sayori on the shoulder."
"I said that more to myself than to her, but it's easy to use Sayori as an internal monologue sometimes."
s 1x "Okay~!"
"Yeah..."
"Let's do this!"
