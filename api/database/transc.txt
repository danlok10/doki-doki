m 2j "Sticking with the Natsuki style once more, I see~"
m 2d "Hmm..."
m "You really like Natsuki, don't you?"
mc "Eh? That's--"
m 5 "Oh, come on, [player]."
m "It's awfully suspicious, you know?"
m "Spending time with her in the clubroom every day..."
m "Pretending to like the manga that she's into..."
mc "Y-You know how Natsuki is...!"
mc "If I don't indulge her, she'll end up hating me."
m 2e "Eh?"
m 2a "No, I think you're misunderstanding, [player]."
m "It's not like Natsuki just hates anyone who doesn't give her what she wants."
m 2d "Yeah, she's assertive, but she's not that selfish..."
m "In fact, I think you're the only one who's indulged her as much as you have."
mc "Is that so..."
"I kind of knew that, but I just didn't want to admit it."
m "So, I just need to ask one thing of you..."
m 1e "...Be careful. Please?"
m "Natsuki is kind of unpredictable."
m "A lot of times, she doesn't even know what she wants."
m 1i "After all, she's the youngest one here."
m "She might not know how to handle her own feelings properly."
m "What I'm saying is..."
m 1m "If something bad happens, then it could end up damaging the club, too..."
m 5 "And you wouldn't do that to me...right?"
mc "That's--"
"I'm not sure how to respond to Monika."
"While I care about her and the club, it's also kind of unfair to bring that up."
m "Well...you're smart."
m "I'm sure you'll do the right thing."
"Monika smiles sweetly."
