mc "I knew it..."
mc "I can see right through you, Sayori."
s 5c "That's not fair!"
s "How did you even know?"
mc "It's simple."
mc "If you had enough money in the first place, you would have bought a snack before coming to the clubroom."
mc "So, either you're not hungry and wanted an excuse to take a walk..."
mc "Or, you planned to conveniently forget that you spent all your money, so that I would lend you some!"
mc "But there's one more thing..."
mc "...You're always hungry!"
mc "And so, that only leaves the one option!"
