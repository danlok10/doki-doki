mc "N-Natsuki..."
"Natsuki glares at me, drying up any words I had in my mouth."
"So instead, I turn to Yuri."
mc "Yuri..."
y 4a "..."
"But Yuri's expression is so defenseless that I can't bring myself to say anything to her."
mc "..."
mc "...Sayori!"
s "Eh?!"
mc "...Yeah!"
mc "Everyone's fighting is making Sayori uncomfortable."
mc "How can the two of you keep fighting when you know you're making your friend feel like this?"
s 4d "[player]..."
n "Well... That's her problem! This isn't about her."
y "I-I agree..."
y "It's unfair for others to interject their own feelings into our conflict."
n 4c "Yeah, unless Sayori wants to tell Yuri what a stuck-up jerk she's being."
y "She would never...!"
y "It's your immaturity that's made her upset in the first place!"
n "{i}Excuse{/i} me?"
n "Are you listening to yourself?"
n 1x "This is exactly why..."
n 1w "Exactly why nobody likes--"
s "Stop!!"

s 1h "Natsuki! Yuri!"
s "You guys are my friends!"
s 1v "I-I just want everyone to get along and be happy!"
s "My friends are wonderful people..."
s "And I love them because of their differences!"
s 1g "Natsuki's poems..."
s "They're amazing because they give you so many feelings with just a few words!"
s "And Yuri's poems are amazing because they paint beautiful pictures in your head!"
s 4k "Everyone's so talented..."
s "...So why are we fighting...?"
n 1r "Be-Because..."
y "Well..."
s 1j "Also!"
s "Natsuki's cute and there's nothing wrong with that!"
s 1i "And Yuri's boobs are the same as they always were!"

mc "Sayori..."
"Sayori stands triumphantly."
"Monika stands behind her with a bewildered expression."
y 3q "I'll...make some tea..."
"Yuri rushes off."
"Natsuki sits down with a blank expression on her face, staring at nothing."
mc "So, this is why Sayori is Vice President..."
"I whisper to Monika."
"She nods in return."
m 1d "To be honest..."
m "I might come off as a good leader, and I can organize things..."
m 3e "But I'm not very good with people..."
m "I couldn't even bring myself to interject."
m 1m "As President, that's kind of embarrassing of me."
m 1l "Ahaha..."
mc "Nah..."
mc "It's not like I can blame you."
mc "I wasn't able to say anything, either."
m "Well..."
m 2a "I guess that just means Sayori is amazing in her own ways, isn't she?"
mc "You could say that."
mc "She might be an airhead, but sometimes it's weirdly suspicious that she knows exactly what she's doing."
m 5 "I see~"
m "Take good care of her, okay?"
m "I would hate to see her get herself hurt."
mc "That makes two of us..."
mc "You can count on me."
"Monika smiles sweetly at me, causing my stomach to knot."
"Such a genuine person really does make a good President, regardless of what she says."
"If only I could get the chance to talk to her a little more..."
