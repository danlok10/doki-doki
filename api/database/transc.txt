mc "Yuri--?"

y "Ah..."
y "Thank goodness..."
mc "You're a little early..."
mc "I'm sorry I wasn't home yet!"
mc "Were you waiting for a long time?"
y 1bf "No, I just got here."
y 1bh "But I started to get really nervous when nobody answered the doorbell..."
mc "You always could have texted me."
mc "If I had known, I would have reassured you and hurried more on my way home."
y 2bv "Ah...I suppose that's true..."
y "I didn't think of that...for some reason."
"It should be common sense to do that, but I decide to ignore it."
mc "Anyway...let's go inside."
mc "I see you brought a lot of stuff with you."
y 1ba "That's right."
y "And did you manage to find everything I asked you to buy as well?"
mc "Yeah, pretty much."
mc "At least, I hope I got everything right."
y "I'm sure it will be fine."
"I take Yuri to my room."
"The first thing she does is glance around curiously, which makes me feel anxious."
y "It's so clean..."
mc "Ahaha..."
mc "I cleaned it before you came over, so..."
y 2ba "That's very considerate of you to do."
mc "Ah, no..."
mc "I would be really embarrassed for my room to be a mess while you were here."
y 1ba "Hmm..."
y "Well, I do enjoy cleaning..."
y "I would have gladly helped you clean."
mc "Ah--"
mc "That would be even more embarrassing!"
mc "Wait, don't look in there--!"
"I snatch Yuri's wrist, which was in the process of opening a desk drawer of mine."
y 3bn "A-Ah..."
y "I'm sorry...!"
y 4bb "I wasn't thinking for some reason..."
y "I was just spacing out!"
mc "It's fine, it's fine..."
"I let go of Yuri's wrist." 
"She puts both of her hands firmly in her lap, as if making sure she's keeping track of them."
mc "So, um..."
mc "Should we...get started?"
y 2bu "Ah..."
y "Yes..."
y 2bf "Um, I have a few things planned that you can help with..."
y "Decorations and other atmospheric enhancements."
mc "Atmospheric enhancements...?"
y 1ba "You know..."
y "Mood lighting, aromatherapy candles..."
mc "Oh, wow."
mc "I didn't know you planned on taking it that far."
y 1bc "Of course."
y "I want to help take our guests to a faraway place."
y 1ba "Although many will stop by just out of curiosity..."
y 1bj "And for...cupcakes, I guess..."
y 1ba "I'm determined to provide an experience that will leave them wanting more."
mc "That's great."
mc "It's easy to forget that you're a pretty intense person."
y 1bt "Ah--"
y 2bt "Intense...?"
mc "I guess that's the best way to put it."
y "Is that...a bad thing?"
mc "No, not at all."
mc "It's something that I like about you, actually."
y 3bu "I-Is that so...?"
y "That makes me feel relieved..."
y "And kind of happy..."
mc "Yeah, no need to be so anxious."
mc "You can relax a little."
y 3bl "Relax..."
y 1bf "I brought some things for relaxation."
y "I was going to use them during the poetry event..."
mc "Oh yeah? Like what?"
y "Let's see..."
"Yuri rummages through her bag."
"She pulls out a few candles and a wooden cylinder-shaped object."
y "I did some shopping on the way here, so I happen to have these in my bag."
y "I planned to cover the windows in black paper and use the candles to light the room."
y 1ba "I think that would be amazing, don't you?"
mc "Yeah, that would be really neat."
mc "What's that wooden thing, though?"
y 1bf "Oh, this?"
y "It's a diffuser for essential oils."
y "How familiar are you with aromatherapy?"
mc "Not familiar at all..."
y 1ba "Ah, is that so?"
y "It's one of my favorite contributors to a positive atmosphere."
y "Depending on the oils or herbs you choose, you can change the mood of the air itself."
y "You can even feel it permeate through your body."
y 3bm "Relaxation, positive energy, romance, reflection..."
y "It's almost like magic."
"Yuri takes the cylinder and pushes a switch on the bottom."
"In just a moment, a thin ray of vapor begins to spout through a small hole on the top."
mc "Wow, that smells wonderful."
mc "What kind of mood is that one for?"
y 1ba "This is a Jasmine essential oil."
y "It smells a little sweet and flowery, right?"
mc "Yeah, that's a good way to describe it."
y 1bb "I chose Jasmine for the event because it provides more than relaxation."
y "Jasmine enhances your emotions and helps you feel them flow through your body."
y 1bu "You feel warmer, and your heart pounds more heavily."
y 1ba "Don't you think that will be perfect for sharing our poems?"
mc "It does sound suitable..."
mc "But you seem to know a lot about this, so I'll trust your opinion with anything."
"Yuri smiles gently, clearly enjoying herself."
"She again reaches into her bag and pulls out several spools of thin ribbon."
mc "What are those for?"
y 1bf "Well..."
y "Did you purchase the origami paper I asked you to get?"
mc "Yeah, I have it over here..."
y "We won't be using the paper for folding origami."
y "What I'd like to do is write a different kanji character on each paper."
y "We'll need about a hundred of them."
mc "Oh yeah?"
mc "What will those be used for?"
y 2bf "Well, I'm going to cut pieces of ribbon to hang from the doorway of the classroom."
y "Then, we can fasten the kanji paper onto the ribbons to create a doorway curtain."
y 2bm "Wouldn't that be beautiful?"
y "It would also catch the eye of those passing by the room..."
y 2ba "It may attract some to peek inside."
mc "That's really creative!"
mc "I had no idea you'd be so good at this, Yuri."
y 4ba "Is...that so?"
y "Well, I suppose I do get a little intense...as you'd put it."
y 3bu "Uhuhu."
"Yuri giggles with red cheeks."
"Is it just me, or is she more relaxed when it's just the two of us?"
"Or maybe it's the excitement she feels from sharing something that she enjoys."
y 1ba "Here's a marker, [player]."
y "You can write any characters you want."
y "I'll help you once I finish cutting the ribbons."
mc "Ah, alright."
"Sitting on the floor together, the two of us get to work."
"I carefully draw a different character on each paper, doing my best to manage my bad handwriting."
"Yuri unravels a long strand of red ribbon to her desired length."
"Then, she reaches into her bag once more and pulls out a pocket knife."
mc "Eh...?"
"The knife is strangely beautiful."
"The silver handle has an intricate pattern of waves etched into it."
"The blade itself is gently tinted blue."
mc "That's no ordinary pocket knife..."
mc "It looks really fancy."
y 4bb "A-Ah..."
y "Well..."
"Embarrassed, Yuri looks away."
mc "What is it?"
y "You're going to think it's weird..."
mc "Yuri, whatever it is, I have no reason to judge."
mc "To each their own, you know?"
y "If you promise you won't be weirded out..."
mc "Yeah, I promise."
y 2bi "Alright..."
y "The thing is, I'm kind of into knives..."
y "They're just...so pretty..."
y 2bv "I-I can't help it!"
y "I don't know what it is..."
y "The combination of craftsmanship and feeling of danger, maybe..."
y 4bb "Uu, what am I saying...?"
y "Please don't think I'm weird for this..."
mc "Ahaha."
y "You're laughing at me..."
mc "No, I'm not laughing at you."
mc "It's just funny how nervous you got about sharing."
mc "It's...well, it's an interesting thing to be into, I guess."
mc "But I think it kind of suits you."
y 2bt "Suits me...?"
mc "Yeah... It's kind of intense. Ahaha."
mc "Besides, it's a really cool-looking knife, I can't deny that."
y 2bu "It is, isn't it...?"
"Yuri relaxes her expression once again."
y 1ba "Would you like to hold it?"
mc "Sure, I'll check it out."
"Yuri carefully hands me the knife, with the handle facing me."
"I take it and turn it around in my hands."
"It feels heavy, and extremely solid."
"Where do you even get a knife like this...?"
"Curious of its sharpness, I feel the point of the knife with my index finger."
mc "Ow--!"
y 3bn "[player]--!!"
y "Why did you do that?!"
mc "I didn't expect it to be that sharp...!"
mc "I barely touched it at all."
y "I-It's my fault!"
y 3bo "I should have warned you..."
y "This knife is extremely sharp..."
y "It can cut through skin like it's paper."
y 2bv "Oh no..."
"A small drop of blood trickles down the side of my finger."
"Yuri takes my hand and gives the wound a closer look."
y 2bt "Ah..."
"She stares at it and noticeably fidgets."
mc "If you're squeamish, I'll go wash it off now--"
mc "A-Ah!"
"Without warning, Yuri puts my finger in her mouth and licks the wound."
"I feel her tongue curl around my finger."
"Startled, I instinctively pull my hand back."
y "O-Oh..."
y 3bo "P-Please forgive me!"
y "I wasn't thinking!"
y 4bc "I..."
"Yuri lowers her head, her face burning up."
mc "Yuri..."
y "That's the most embarrassing thing I've ever done..."
y "How could I do something like that??"
y "I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
mc "Ah..."
"Sure, it was a little weird, and it took me by surprise..."
"But I guess she was just trying to help, right...?"
mc "Yuri, I think you're overreacting a little..."
y "Uuuh..."
"She doesn't lift her head."
"What if she doesn't recover from this for the rest of the afternoon?"
mc "Alright, you know what..."
"This might be a stupid thing to do, but I do it anyway."
"I take Yuri's hand and lick her index finger in return."

mc "N-Now we're even..."
y 3bv "..."
"Yuri just looks at me like I did something wrong."
mc "Ahaha..."
mc "I knew that would be a bad idea..."
"If not for the sweet aroma of the Jasmine oil, the air would be extremely heavy right now."

mc "Look, it already stopped bleeding."

y "That's relieving."
"The tension is quickly lifted."
"We each resume our respective activities."
"I watch Yuri's knife cut through the ribbon like it's nothing but air."
"Meanwhile, I continue to make progress on the kanji."
"After we finish attaching the paper to the ribbons, we lay them all out side by side."
"It looks better than I expected and will be very effective as a door curtain."
mc "It looks great."
mc "Good thinking coming up with this, Yuri."

y 1ba "Are you ready to move onto the next task?"
mc "Yeah, let's do it."
mc "What do you have in mind?"
y "I'd like to create a banner."
y "That's why I asked you to buy the paint tablets."
mc "Ah, that's right."
"One of the items Yuri had asked me to buy was a kit of watercolor paint tablets."
y 1bf "We'll need about six cups of water to put each of the tablets in."
y "Do you mind fetching those for us?"
mc "Of course not."
mc "Six cups of water..."
mc "I'll be right back in a minute."
y 1ba "Thank you very much."
y 2bf "Oh, and just a little bit of water is okay."
y "If you fill the cups too much, it will be too diluted."
"Taking Yuri's advice, I decide to use small plastic bathroom cups rather than full-sized glasses."
"I put them on a plate to catch any paint that drips, then bring it back into my room."
mc "Yuri?"

mc "Is it too hot in here, or anything?"
y 3bq "Ah--"
y "No, not at all!"
y "There's nothing wrong, so..."
y "Let's mix the paint."
"Yuri hurriedly dismisses me and takes it upon herself to unwrap the tablets, dropping them into the cups."
y 1ba "So..."
y "I thought we would do something simple that would look very nice."
y "I'd like to paint a gradient across the banner..."
y "Starting with the colors for a sunrise, then daytime, then sunset and nighttime."
y "Once it dries, I'll write an inspirational quote across the banner."
y "We can hang it on the wall behind the podium at the front of the classroom."
mc "Ah, neat."
mc "What are you going to write?"
y 2bm "Well..."
y "...It will be more fun to surprise you."
"Yuri smiles at me."
mc "If you say so..."
"After rolling out the banner, Yuri and I kneel on opposite sides so we don't get in the way of each other."
"Yuri uses a brush and adds a few dots of different colors across the banner to serve as a color guide when we paint."
mc "This kind of reminds me of elementary school..."
"Painting on a banner with watercolors feels a lot like the art class projects we had back then."
"It's relaxing."

y "It is fun."
y "I'm glad you feel that way, too."
"Yuri stops painting for a moment, thinking to herself."
y 2bl "For me..."
y "I don't need to go out and do crazy things to have fun."
y "In fact, I usually don't even want to."
y 2bf "I just like when I can spend time with one other person..."
y "Even if it's something simple, like reading - it doesn't even matter if we don't talk much."
y 2ba "Just having a friend next to me makes things feel a little bit nicer."
y "I think that's all it takes for me to be happy."
mc "Is that so...?"
"Even if Yuri and I are quite different, I can understand where she's coming from."
"I feel that way about things like anime and games, where simply sharing the experience with someone can make me happy."
mc "I think I feel the same way."
"Yuri smiles gently."
y 1bm "I knew you'd understand..."
"Yuri leans over the banner to grab an unused paintbrush."
"But I move at the same time, causing my head to bump into hers."
y 3bn "Kya--!"
mc "S-Sorry!"
"Yuri reels back, and I quickly lift my hands in surprise."
mc "Are you hurt?"
y 2bv "N-No, I'm not hurt."
y "It just startled me...that's all."
y "Sorry, I should have asked you to get it for me..."
mc "It's not your fault."
mc "Ah, your face..."
"There are droplets of paint on Yuri's face and neck."
y 2bt "Is there something on my face?"
mc "Yeah, I accidentally got paint on you..."
mc "Sorry, it's totally my fault!"
mc "I'll get a towel right away."
"I rush out and fetch a small towel, then I dampen it with hot water."
"I return to my room and kneel back down in front of her."
mc "Here..."
"I pat down Yuri's face and neck with the towel."
y "Ah--"
mc "Is something wrong?"
y "It's hot...I just didn't expect it."
mc "Sorry..."
mc "I didn't want to use cold water."
"Having finished, I start to retract my hand."

y "Wait--"
mc "Eh?"
y "Just...for a little longer."
y "It feels really nice..."
mc "Ah..."
"I keep my hand still against Yuri's neck."
"She looks into my eyes."
"It's an intense expression that I recognize from when she reads her books..."
"Almost as if she's lost in a daze, enveloped by her own thoughts."
"She breathes gently, half through slightly-parted lips."
"What is happening...?"
"Is it the aroma of the Jasmine oil giving me this dizzy feeling?"
"Yuri's gentle fingers, wrapped around my wrist, send a tingling sensation through my arm."
"And suddenly, her face seems to be much closer to mine than it was just a moment ago..."
y "Ah..."
"Yuri slowly pulls away."
y "Sorry..."
y "I've been feeling a little light-headed today."
y "I didn't mean to space out..."
mc "I-It's fine..."
"The moment is over as soon as it began."
"Yuri picks up her brush again."
"But her movements seem clumsier, like she's unable to focus."
"I remain silent, forced to ignore the event that just transpired."
"I hesitantly retrieve my own brush and continue following Yuri's example."
mc "That should do it..."
"I finish filling the night sky with white dots that looks like stars."
"Looking at the banner as a whole, it's very pretty and natural-looking."
y "I think it came out better than I expected."
y "I'm really happy with the results."
mc "Yeah, me too."
mc "Are you going to add the lettering now?"
y 1bf "Ah, not yet..."
y "It needs to dry first."
mc "That's true, but won't that take a while?"
y 2bh "Well..."
y "Perhaps it would be best to leave it here, then have you bring it in the morning."
y 2bf "I can do the lettering in the classroom before our event starts."
y "Is that okay?"
mc "That's totally fine."
y 1ba "Wonderful."
y "In that case..."
y "I don't think there's anything more for us to do here."
mc "Phew."
