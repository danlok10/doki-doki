An old tale tells of a lady who wanders Earth.</br>The Lady who Knows Everything.</br>A beautiful lady who has found every answer,</br>All meaning,</br>All purpose,</br>And all that was ever sought.</br></br>And here I am,</br></br>a feather</br></br>Lost adrift the sky, victim of the currents of the wind.</br></br>Day after day, I search.</br>I search with little hope, knowing legends don't exist.</br>But when all else has failed me,</br>When all others have turned away,</br>The legend is all that remains - the last dim star glimmering in the twilit sky.</br></br>Until one day, the wind ceases to blow.</br>I fall.</br>And I fall and fall, and fall even more.</br>Gentle as a feather.</br>A dry quill, expressionless.</br></br>But a hand catches me, between the thumb and forefinger.</br>The hand of a beautiful lady.</br>I look at her eyes and find no end to her gaze.</br></br>The Lady who Knows Everything knows what I am thinking.</br>Before I can speak, she responds in a hollow voice.</br>'I have found every answer, all of which amount to nothing.</br>There is no meaning.</br>There is no purpose.</br>And we seek only the impossible.</br>I am not your legend.</br>Your legend does not exist.'</br></br>And with a breath, she blows me back afloat, and I pick up a gust of wind.</br>
