<h1>Doki Doki Literature Club For Web Browsers</h1>

The popular anime visual novel DDLC programmed from zero in vanilla javascript, in order to make it playable in a web browser. It was my first big proyect, I started it when I had few notions of web development, so it's full of errors and terrible practices, but I managed to build the entire game and make it run exactly like the original with very few tools.

Some of the many concepts I handle in this project are:

    CSS animations
    Responsive Design
    POO
    Consuming data from API
    Audio Handling 
    Image storage

<h2><b>Notes:</h2> This project is a fork of elRomanoff’s Doki Doki Webport on GitHub. My goal is to fully complete the port, as the original version was left unfinished at day 4.
During this process, I’ll also be addressing existing issues and implementing improvements where necessary.

Once the full port is complete, I may create another fork aimed at developing a standalone web version, an HTML build that runs independently without requiring a host.
No guarantees yet, but it’s something I plan to explore.</b>
